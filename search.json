    "text": "The Solon Rotary Club is aiming to increase member engagement. A 4-question survey was designed to solicit information on member availability and which planned service events have the most interest. Members also had the opportunity to detail scheduling challenges and suggest additional opportunities.\nThe survey was conducted via Google Forms and distributed to club members via email and WhatsApp on Friday 04/25/2025. The results in this report are based on the responses as of Friday 05/02/2025. A total of 17 out of 26 members (65.4%) completed the survey, and all responses were anonymous."

    "text": "6.1 Engagement\nThe response rate was 65.4%, or 17 out of 26 members. 9 members (34.6%) did not respond to the survey. It’s hard to draw conclusions from missing data, but this may represent the share of members least likely to participate in volunteer activities. There may be better ways to communicate with members than the current method(s).\n\nInsights\n\nEmails mostly come from personal accounts.\nMembers can ‘reply-all’ to emails.\nEmails don’t always have informative subject lines or are chain emails (e.g. “Fw: CVIC - Logistics for April Food Pantry”).\nGroup chats like WhatsApp can lead to notification fatigue.\n\nOpportunities\n\nSet up website-based emails (e.g. president@solonrotary.org, admin@solonrotary.org) that include “Solon Rotary Club” in the name (e.g. Solon Rotary Club; President, Solon Rotary Club).\nUse Bcc to send emails to Members@solonrotary.org. Instead, Cc the person in charge of replies.\nProvide a roster of contact information to members.\nPrioritize using Volunteer Mark to communicate volunteer needs to members (in progress)."
